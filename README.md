# Data-Driven-Strategies-for-Spotify-insights
### Problem Statement
<p align="justify">
The music streaming landscape is highly competitive, and artists and their stakeholders must
navigate the challenges of optimizing their tracks for market demands. Even though there are
several platforms like Spotify that offer valuable data about music attributes and listener
behavior, there is an opportunity gap that could help artists turn those metrics into actionable
insight that provide them with a path to long-term success.<br><br></p>
<p align="justify">
Previous studies primarily analyse isolated attributes like danceability, energy, and tempo, and
do not tend to account for track-level feature-artist demographics-genre interaction. Moreover,
work on how clustering techniques or predictive analytics can identify market opportunities for
the independent artist or assess the potential return on investment (ROI) for stakeholders has
been overlooked.</p>

### This project addresses these gaps by exploring the following critical questions
1. What are the critical success factors influencing Spotify music popularity?<br>
2. How can clustering techniques identify market positioning opportunities for
independent artists?<br>
3. What role does music genre play in shaping the popularity of tracks?<br>
4. How can predictive models of popularity inform Return on Investment (ROI) for
stakeholders?
